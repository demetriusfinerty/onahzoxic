I'm really confused with the whole idea of no standard file extension for denoting executable files. Is the kernel hard-wired to only execute ELF files as a normal process, or could. say. a plain text file be executed as an entire process ???? If files other than ELF files can, in fact, be executed as normal processes, then how would the kernel know what to do with them. Sorry for my lack of know-how with the internals of Linux, but I'm genuinely curious. Thanks. keywords_antrouter_beerouter_flyrouter_skyrouter_sinus1054_adm5120_bcm6345_rtl8186_rtl8650b_linux_роутер. Добро пожаловать на сайт компании FlyRouter. Hi there, I recently had a new workstation built for me, with the Threadripper 2950x CPU cooled with a Noctua - NH-U14S TR4-SP3 fan. The computer is dual boot Windows 10 Pro/Linux Mint Cinnamon 19, and the guy that built it for me helped me fine tune the overclocking settings in the BIOS and the voltage levels for the CPU so that in Windows 10 Pro it doesn't throttle at all under a heavy stress test load. However he is not familiar with Linux, and neither am I. When I boot in Linux Блог о системном администрировании. Статьи о Linux, Windows, СХД NetApp и виртуализации. 
I have a few Xubuntu (18.04) machines at home sharing /home folders. Samba is easier to install and works with mac/windows, but I find SSHFS to be native, stable and extremely fast (11MBit/s on 100Base-TX wired) between two Linux SSD-laptops. Here's how to set up sshfs networking and automatically reconnect after reboot using fstab without having to provide a password.

I'm an IT noob, working on the transition from retail sales to IT. I actively searching jobs after I got my CCNA, however, most entry-level position in small-medium business requires MCSA. And I'm wondering if it is possible that I can go Linux path directly without Microsoft. With the current "cloud" trend, is it necessary to learn Microsoft Server in 2019? Please advise. Thank 
Live USB (читается как лайв ю-эс-би) — подключаемый по шине USB носитель данных, содержащий операционную систему с возможностью загрузки. I have a bit of a bizarre issue, i've looked to the best of my ability through the manjaro and arch forums, and through google and to no avail. On Linux specifically, both when I tried Ubuntu and now with Manjaro, I have a delay in the caps lock functionality. I am a rather fast typer, so it's not uncommon for me to hit 110ish WPM just averagely typing, and it seems when i hit the higher speeds it will happen. (like HEllo instead of Hello) usually only by one or two characters at the most. Теперь, при перезагрузке, этот сетевой интерфейс запустится автоматически. Для проверки - запустился ли он, я использую команду ifconfig, которую ввожу в терминале гостевой операционной системы. Like most here I used Linux mostly, except for those pesky games that seemed to never really take up on Linux. I've been monitoring Steam Linux titles since the beginning, but as of earlier this year the count was still 80/250 titles on my account, with the best ones not in there. Of course I've been trying to buy games that do run on Linux, but you know, AAA titles man. But, suddenly, Proton! Around Wine's 1.0 version (2002-ish?), I switched to Linux full-time for about Системные требования: Windows 7 или более поздней версии, неважно, 32 или 64 бит. После загрузки приложение готово к использованию. 
I've been wondering on whether if it is possible to completely remove Android OS and make it Linux only. I don't mind using Planet Computer's own distro What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. Programming, use VS Code mostly for web development. Also quite a bit of live sports streaming. What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? ~ 750 USD When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy. Within the next couple weeks. I've been using linux for around 7 years now. I started pushed by the circumstances when my mum managed to delete some essentail windows files from her laptop and came to me "because you know about this stuff". We needed a cost-less solution that didn't rely on CD's and of course at the time I had no idea that it was so easy to make windows live-USBs. Then BAM, ubuntu and everything solved in 20 minutes. Ever since then I've been using it myself, alternating with windows for some windows exclus. 
Total budget and country of purchase: 0-0 USD, USA Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. Specs above all, 8GB RAM, i5, IPS, 1080p, NumPad is a MUST. 1TB HDD, or a mix between a boot SSD and a smaller HDD would be good as well. How important is weight and thinness to you? Neither are a factor, however I don't need a fat laptop like a gaming one that needs extra space Some new live builds have been released today?. and for mac and linux. they seem smaller, are there any changes? Edit: I think they are just mac and linux releases for the latest build. Agreed that the whole thing is a bait and switch in terms of how incomplete Linux support is I'm quite happy with mine though, but it's taken way too much effort to get there Disagree with the screen format and touch complaints - with a vertical taskbar and the relative mouse input mod on OESF it works great Agreed the kernel is unacceptably old and hacky (holy shit the dmesg spam), and the keyboard is way spongier and less responsive than it should be, even in a device of this size. I've noticed a weird bug? That occurs every time I load into SMO. I can enter the title screen, start a game and load saves, but almost immediately when I go into the game my system hangs and I need to hard reset it. Im using an AMD gpu with the amdgpu drivers and the git version of Mesa. This occurred even using the stable version as well, and occurred a month ago when I tried the latest Canary build. I plan to do some logging to see if there is a seg fault before my system hangs Hey everyone, I am very new to this so please forgive me if my question seems stupid. I see people making partitions on their computers hard drive, the same hard drive that have their other OS installed on. The problem with that for me, is that I have a 128 SSD and it has my windows installed on it, I would like to keep that SSD for windows only. is it possible to install linux on a internal HDD and still get the boot-up option to switch between. (I hope this is the right sub for this kind of discussion?) The reason I want you to talk me out of it is that my current build isn't struggling to perform (I mainly game), but it's dated in terms of CPU and RAM and I am drawn to the idea of a fast little mini-PC build. I also don't have a specific use for a Linux only PC other than that it interests me and I want to use/learn the platform. I want to start a discussion on this if there are people that have been in a similar position of having. Curious about how the linux support is like in real-life, with the T480 models. (Looking to replace a yoga920 to a t480, in part for a nicer keyboard, in part for the option to upgrade to 32gb ram later on, and in large part to get a decent port selection But, going back to the Linux compatibility. Are there some common issues that T480's have with, idk, mics/audio/card-readers/fingerprint sensors? Or some weird dual-battery shenanigans? I have an XPS 13 notebook, and I've noticed that when I have a heavy 1 thread load like single thread video encoding, it will switch back and forth between core 1 and core 2 to keep temps down. I dual boot with Windows 10, and this isn't something I've noticed in it. Either way, I think it's a pretty cool idea; it seems able to keep the fan off longer than Windows during operations

Hi, I'd like to buy a little 10" (around this size) notebook (it's better if the screen is a touchscreen) to study, manage emails, browsing web, do retrogaming (until ps2-wii).
