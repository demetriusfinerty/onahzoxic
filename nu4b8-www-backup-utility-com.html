I'm looking to swap out my PC's internal HDD for an SSD and have a couple of questions. A) Whats the best way to simply image everything from the HDD to the SSD and B) Should I image everything over, or is it better to do a clean install of Windows 10? I do not have access to a second computer, so any method of imaging everything over would have to be done with the computer that I'm upgrading. Before I get the SSD, I plan on getting an external drive large enough to be able to store an image. 
Recently started a new build and I am wondering if anyone has a good solution to transporting my OS and all my data files to a new larger hard drive with out having to install my old drive. I've found some online instructions but they seem complicated and it looks like I have to pay for programs I'll only use once. TLDR I want to install my OS without having to buy it and start. I just bought a 120 ssd and I want to know how can I transfer. After reading a post where you guys said the 128gb is enough, I have the 256gb model and I'm constantly running out of space, so I figure you guys must have a secret. I have lie 90gb of other space. I just purched a ssd drive and while it is shipping I am trying to prepare myself for the task ahead. What I am planning on doing is backing up my files trimming away everything except the OS and then cloning it to the new drive, which will become my boot drive. Afterwards I would like to restore all files to the orignal hdd including program files. Is this possible by simple moving the files to a backup drive and moving them back afterwards? I have some programs that would be very hard to reins. So I have like 950 GB of my 2 TB drive full of an assortment of games, music, movies, and random bullshit. I don't own an external drive, but I'm working on that. I've looked up guides on how to do this, but they don't say how to move programs as well. Any help would be appreciated, brothers.
